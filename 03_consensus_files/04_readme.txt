These programs will filter the mask files and use both the filtered and unfiltered mask files to calculate the number of called sites on a given interval. 

The called_sites directory contains four directories within that will each calculate the number of called sites on a separate galaxy interval. 

	The files will take data from the mask_files directory and count the number of 		called sites.
