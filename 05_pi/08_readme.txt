This set of programs should be run in the order that they are numbered. 

They compute the minor alleys using the temps files, then they compute the allele frequency. The allele frequency is then used to calculate pi, which is the nucleotide diversity. 

The nucleotide diversity is normalized with the chimpanzee (pantry) and rhesus macaque (RheMac3) to correct for mutation rate. 

05_normalized_pi_no_without_high_divergence has the diversity normalized with panTro4 and rheMac3 when the high divergence regions are filtered out.
