The PAR_Project is a study that computes the nucleotide diversity along the X chromosome of 26 unrelated females in order to look at the diversity differences between the recombining and non-recombinging regions. 

	There are two pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) on the sex chromosomes that recombine 	during male meiosis. The PAR1 is approximately 2.7 Mb and the PAR2 is 			approximately 320kb on the tips of the sex chromosomes. 

	It is expected that due to the recombination, the PARs will have a higher 		nucleotide diversity. In this study, we look at the PAR boundary, which is thought 	to be due to an inversion of the XG gene that spans the PAR boundary.  We use the 	nucleotide diversity to see if there is a strict boundary between the recombining 	and non-recombining  regions. The mutation rate is controlled by normalizing the 	human data with data from the chimpanzee and the rhesus macaque. 

	In this study, we also look at the diversity in the X-transposed region (XTR), 		which is human specific and according to a recent study is thought to be a third 	PAR. 

The Codes directory was created first and the panTro3 and rheMac2 data alignments were used. The Codes_02 directory contains the data for panTro4 and rheMac3 and is therefore more current. The Codes_03 directory remains unfinished and contains the refs analysis. The Codes_04 directory contains the analysis excluding the low diversity and ampliconic regions.
