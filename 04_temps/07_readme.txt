These files separate the original GGS data into several thousand temp files that correspond to the windows. 

The input is CGS.all26.txt and the files are output to the folders within this directory.

These files are then used when calculating information for a specific window. 

When running more than one chromosome, the program should be modified to a loop that print each chromosomeâ€™s data to a specific temp folder. Intervals will also need to be changed.

When the project is finished, all temp files should be cleared.
